# PCA and KMeans – Unsupervised Learning
This repository contains a small project on unsupervised learning using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans clustering.
The analysis is done on a City Lifestyle dataset with indicators such as income, rent, population density, transport, and air quality.
# What is done
- Data cleaning and selection of numeric features
- Standardization of variables
- PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- KMeans clustering
- Interpretation of clusters using original variables
# Tools
